  # Fix RLS Policies for Custom Admin Auth

  1. Changes
    - Update RLS policies to work without Supabase Auth
    - Allow anonymous users to perform admin operations (client-side auth only)
    - This is suitable for a CMS where admin login is handled client-side

  2. Security Note
    - In production, you should use Supabase Auth or Edge Functions for proper authentication
    - Current implementation relies on client-side session management
