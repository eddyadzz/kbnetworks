# Fixes Applied - Issues Resolved! ‚úÖ

## Issue 1: Forms Not Sending to Telegram - FIXED ‚úÖ

### Problem
- Forms were not sending messages to Telegram
- Environment variables were not being read

### Root Cause
The Telegram bot token and chat ID were missing the `VITE_` prefix, which is required for Vite to expose environment variables to the browser.

### Fix Applied
1. Updated `.env` file to use `VITE_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `VITE_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`
2. Updated `src/utils/telegram.ts` to read the correct variable names
3. Added better error logging to help debug credential issues

### What You Need to Do
**NOTHING!** Your credentials are already configured correctly in the `.env` file:
```
VITE_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=7542985925:AAEmDXfCVkdoxViS0rL7Ai3tHvowR7U3kno
VITE_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=-1003026785383
```

**Just restart your dev server** and forms will work immediately!

## Issue 2: Brands Table Not Found - PARTIALLY FIXED ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Problem
- Admin panel shows "Brands table not found" error
- Trying to save brands fails
- Error: `Could not find the table 'public.brands' in the schema cache`

### Root Cause
The `brands` table exists in your database, but **Supabase's PostgREST schema cache hasn't been updated** to recognize it yet.

### Current Status
‚úÖ **Website works** - Shows default brands as fallback
‚úÖ **No errors on public pages**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Admin panel** - Can't manage brands until cache is reloaded

### Fix Required (Your Action)
You need to **reload the Supabase schema cache**:

**Option 1: Via Dashboard (Easiest)**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Settings ‚Üí API
3. Click **"Reload schema"** button
4. Wait for confirmation
5. Refresh your app

**Option 2: Via SQL**
Run in SQL Editor:
```sql
NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';
```

**Option 3: Wait**
Sometimes it auto-refreshes in 5-10 minutes

See `BRANDS_FIX.md` for detailed instructions.
